We've provided countless families with the instruction needed to give kids a strong foundation in music, all from the comfort and convenience of your own home. You do not need to be musically inclined, just follow our simple instructions and you will have beautiful music being played in your home in no time.</p>

					<h2>Piano tip of the week!</h2>
					<p>When teaching a very young piano student for the first time, they may not know their right hand from their left. Put a sticker on each one of their hands - "L" for left, and "R" for right!
					<br><br>Soon they will remember which hand is which without the stickers. If you do not have stickers, with the parent's permission you can write the letters on their hand.</p>
