					<h2>Piano tip of the week!</h2>
					<p>When teaching a very young piano student for the first time, they may not know their right hand from their left. Put a sticker on each one of their hands - "L" for left, and "R" for right!
					<br><br>Soon they will remember which hand is which without the stickers. If you do not have stickers, with the parent's permission you can write the letters on their hand.</p>
